Title: Crop Production Forecasting using LSTM and XGBoost
Overview
This project predicts crop production by combining LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series modeling and XGBoost for boosted decision trees.
The dataset includes agricultural, climatic, and soil parameters merged into a unified dataset to improve prediction accuracy.

Features
Data Exploration – Summary statistics, missing value checks, correlation analysis.

Data Visualization – Graphical representation of production trends, climate patterns, and correlations.

Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, feature engineering, encoding, and merging datasets.

Modeling – Hybrid approach using LSTM and XGBoost.

Evaluation – Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² score.

Dataset
The project uses three datasets:

Agricultural Data – Contains crop-wise production details.

Climate Data – Includes rainfall, temperature, and other climatic parameters.

Soil Data – Features soil fertility and nutrient levels.

These datasets are merged using a common set of keys such as District Name, Year, and Season.
